To run this simply run it! 

It will ask if you want to add a path, if you enter y it will ask you to enter the FULL path and add into the "Start_Executables_Paths.txt" in the same folder as the script, if not then it will run all the ececutables in that .txt file.

This is my first(and probably only) script I have made for the public it will most likely not be upkept but feel free to do it yourselves!
